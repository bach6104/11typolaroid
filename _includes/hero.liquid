    With Polaroid Cloud, you can sync your photos to your favorite cloud service
    while still enjoying the instant printing youâ€™ve come to expect from Polaroid.
    Once you insert special instant photo paper, your image is uploaded to the web
    and a QR code is generated and printed with the instant photo.
